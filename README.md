### Hi! I'm Kolby Dunning and I am a self-taught developer. I have knowledge with PHP, Java and Python, along with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Typescript.

A few of the projects I've worked on are below:
- [Spotify Playlist Generator](https://github.com/kolbyd/spotify-playlist-generator) | A script to convert my Spotify liked songs into a playlist.
- [Push to Mute for Windows](https://github.com/kolbyd/Push-to-Mute) | Set a button to hold that mutes your Windows sound.
- [With You Bot](https://github.com/winnipegfir/with-you-bot) | An overengineered counter in a discord bot that includes database integration.
- [Winnipeg FIR Website](https://github.com/winnipegfir/CZWG-core) | The repository for the first website I worked on.

## Need help with a project?
I am always looking to help people make their ideas come to life. Please email me at [kolby@kolbyd.ca](mailto:kolby@kolbyd.ca) to reach out.
